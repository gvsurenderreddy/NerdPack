<p align="center">
NerdPack Profiles For ProbablyEngine.
NeP is a natural evolution of MTSP, ive created this project using PE's engine & custom libs. <br/>
NeP goal is to be light but with advanced features. <br/>
Will try to work on every class/spec the best i can & implement moust of the requested enhancements but im sharing this with the goal of more people pitchin in and contributing back ( the way open-source is meant to be used ). <br/>
Before asking for help follow the Instructions: Make sure you'r fully updated (PE, Lua unlocker & NeP) and have used your choosen lua unlocker, if nothing works try and disabling all other addons. </p>
